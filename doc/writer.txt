 2.- CUSTOMIZATION                                         *writer-customize*

To customize your 'journal' directory, add this to your vimrc:

    let g:writer_journal_dir = 'path/to/journal/'                            ~

And to choose which theme to load on default:

    let g:writer_theme = dark                                               ~

functions that make it easy to isolate your writing.

 2.- CUSTOMIZATION                                         *writer-customize*

To customize your 'journal' directory, add this to your vimrc:

    let g:writer_journal_dir = '~/path/to/journal/'                            ~

And to choose which theme to load on default, accepts 'light' (default), or
'dark':

    let g:writer_theme = 'dark'                                               ~

To choose default wrapping mode, accepts 'hard' (default) or 'soft':

    let g:writer_wrap = 'soft'                                                ~

To choose which font to use as default, use the same format as `set guifont`:
with the exception of double escaping any spaces.

    let g:writer_font = "Consolas:h18"                                        ~
    let g:writer_font = "Source\\ Code\\ Pro:h18"                                        ~

        <p>Writer is a minimal colorscheme for Vim built to isolate your writing (All the
cool kids are doing it these days.) It's got two themes, light and dark (which
you can switch between on the fly) and some basic usage functions to help stop
fooling around and start making 'clackety noise' (via
<a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">@hotdogsladies</a>).</p>

<p>It's based off of two "distraction free" environments,
<a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a> and
<a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">IAWriter</a>. Since I use Vim for everything involving
text I recreated these environments for myself. (If you do not use/care to
learn Vim, I'd recommend you check out both products.)</p>

<p>I've also <del>shamelessly copied</del> borrowed Ethan
Schoover's definition and variable structure from his <a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized">Solarized
theme</a> (Which I also highly
recommend).</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Writer was built with only <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>
in mind. It will not work in the terminal, and I have not tested it on other
Vim GUI wrappers. If you'd like support for your GUI wrapper, please contribute!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you run Pathogen to manage your plugins, you can clone this into your
bundles folder:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/nathanlong/vim-colors-writer.git
~/.vim/bundle/colors-writer
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can just download it and pop it into your <code>.vim/colors/</code> and
<code>.vim/plugins</code> directories.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p><code>&lt;leader&gt;wr</code> - Loads writer into your current buffer</p>

<p><code>&lt;leader&gt;wj</code> - Creates a new dated journal file (format: YYMMDD.md) inside
your specified journal directory.</p>

<p><code>&lt;leader&gt;wq</code> - Switches between dark and light themes while in fullscreen mode</p>

<p><code>&lt;leader&gt;wc</code> - Closes writer and reapplies your defaults</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>I've also included a few options for customization:</p>

<p>To customize your 'journal' directory, add this to your vimrc:</p>

<pre><code>let g:writer_journal_dir = 'path/to/journal/'
</code></pre>

<p>And to choose which theme to load on default:</p>

<pre><code>let g:writer_theme = dark
</code></pre>

<p>(The default is the light theme.)</p>

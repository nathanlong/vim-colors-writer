{"name":"Writer","body":"Writer is a minimal colorscheme for Vim built to isolate your writing (All the\r\ncool kids are doing it these days.) It's got two themes, light and dark (which\r\nyou can switch between on the fly) and some basic usage functions to help stop\r\nfooling around and start making 'clackety noise' (via\r\n[@hotdogsladies](http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies)).\r\n\r\nIt's based off of two \"distraction free\" environments,\r\n[WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) and\r\n[IAWriter](http://www.iawriter.com/). Since I use Vim for everything involving\r\ntext I recreated these environments for myself. (If you do not use/care to\r\nlearn Vim, I'd recommend you check out both products.)\r\n\r\nI've also <del>shamelessly copied</del> borrowed Ethan\r\nSchoover's definition and variable structure from his [Solarized\r\ntheme](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) (Which I also highly\r\nrecommend).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> Note: Writer was built with only [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)\r\n> in mind. It will not work in the terminal, and I have not tested it on other\r\n> Vim GUI wrappers. If you'd like support for your GUI wrapper, please contribute!\r\n\r\nIf you run Pathogen to manage your plugins, you can clone this into your\r\nbundles folder:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/nathanlong/vim-colors-writer.git\r\n    ~/.vim/bundle/colors-writer\r\n\r\nOr you can just download it and pop it into your `.vim/colors/` and\r\n`.vim/plugins` directories.\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\n`<leader>wr` - Loads writer into your current buffer\r\n\r\n`<leader>wj` - Creates a new dated journal file (format: YYMMDD.md) inside\r\nyour specified journal directory.\r\n\r\n`<leader>wq` - Switches between dark and light themes while in fullscreen mode\r\n\r\n`<leader>wc` - Closes writer and reapplies your defaults\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\nI've also included a few options for customization:\r\n\r\nTo customize your 'journal' directory, add this to your vimrc:\r\n\r\n    let g:writer_journal_dir = 'path/to/journal/'\r\n\r\nAnd to choose which theme to load on default:\r\n\r\n    let g:writer_theme = dark\r\n\r\n(The default is the light theme.)","note":"Don't delete this file!
